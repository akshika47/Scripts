# Scripts
This repo contains scripts that I have created for different purposes. They made my life easier hope it will make yours too.

## How to use "Facebook_Privacy.js"
This script makes it easier for you to change your privacy with regard to pages you like and follow. Normally your friends can see when you like a page or follow a page. But you can change this to be private. Do the following steps in order to do that.
1. Follow this [link](https://www.facebook.com/help/community/question/?id=726726154141626) to get to the likes section in Facebook.
2. Then you will get a list of sections that you can make private. This is a lengthy repetitive task so you can use the script to automate this process.
3. Then open up the console in your browser and copy paste the js code in the repo and run it.
